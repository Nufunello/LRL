LRL - Less Routine Library provides with syntax sugar for trivial routines to reduce code amount when it's not necessary

TESTS:
To run tests you need specify TESTS_ONLY=TRUE while doing cmaking

Purposes of tests:
  1)Correctness
  2)Zero-cost: same binary code for code with and without library syntax sugar

Tested environments(CMake):
  * Win 10, MinGW 64 (x86_64-8.1.0-win32-seh-rt_v6-rev0)
  //Hoping this list will include much more envs
